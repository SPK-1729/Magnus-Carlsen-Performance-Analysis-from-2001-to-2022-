Abstract

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of Magnus Carlsen's performance in chess from 2001 to 2022, utilizing two distinct datasets (ds1 and ds2). The analysis covers various facets of Carlsen's gameplay across different dimensions, including win, loss, and draw rates over time represented in bar plots and pie charts. Additionally, performance trends are examined based on Carlsen's White and Black Elo ratings through line charts. The study further investigates Carlsen's performance across different chess sites, average opponent Elo ratings, and specific chess events. Detailed analyses of Carlsen's success rates and strategic patterns in relation to chess openings, including ECO codes and variants, are also presented. Insights into Carlsen's most frequently used openings and his performance against specific opponents, categorized by their Elo thresholds, provide further granularity. The project concludes with a comprehensive overview of game termination types, chess piece dynamics, and capture analyses influencing Carlsen's game outcomes. This documentation aims to offer a nuanced understanding of Magnus Carlsen's strategic prowess and performance dynamics over the past two decades.
