# Magnus Carlsen Performance Analysis from-2001 to 2022 

---
# Abstract of the Project
---

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of Magnus Carlsen's performance in chess from 2001 to 2022, utilizing two distinct datasets (ds1 and ds2). The analysis covers various facets of Carlsen's gameplay across different dimensions, including win, loss, and draw rates over time represented in bar plots and pie charts. Additionally, performance trends are examined based on Carlsen's White and Black Elo ratings through line charts. The study further investigates Carlsen's performance across different chess sites, average opponent Elo ratings, and specific chess events. Detailed analyses of Carlsen's success rates and strategic patterns in relation to chess openings, including ECO codes and variants, are also presented. Insights into Carlsen's most frequently used openings and his performance against specific opponents, categorized by their Elo thresholds, provide further granularity. The project concludes with a comprehensive overview of game termination types, chess piece dynamics, and capture analyses influencing Carlsen's game outcomes. This documentation aims to offer a nuanced understanding of Magnus Carlsen's strategic prowess and performance dynamics over the past two decades.

# Libraries Used in the project:
---

# pandas:

pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like DataFrames and Series, which are useful for handling structured data.
seaborn (import seaborn as sns):

# seaborn:
seaborn is a statistical data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
matplotlib.pyplot (import matplotlib.pyplot as plt):

# matplotlib:

matplotlib.pyplot is a collection of command-style functions that make matplotlib work like MATLAB. It is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
These libraries together provide a robust toolkit for data analysis, manipulation, and visualization in Python.

# Functions and Methods used in the project

---

pandas:
pd.read_csv(): Used to read data from CSV files into pandas DataFrame.

DataFrame.head(): Returns the first n rows of the DataFrame (default is 5).

DataFrame.info(): Provides a concise summary of the DataFrame, including data types and missing values.

DataFrame.describe(): Generates descriptive statistics (like mean, median, etc.) of numerical columns in the DataFrame.

DataFrame.groupby(): Groups DataFrame using a mapper or by a Series of columns.

DataFrame.plot(): Plots data directly from a DataFrame using matplotlib.

Series.value_counts(): Returns a Series containing counts of unique values.

seaborn:
sns.barplot(): Shows the counts of observations in each categorical bin using bars.

sns.lineplot(): Flexibly plots a univariate distribution of observations.

sns.scatterplot(): Draws a scatter plot with possibility of several semantic groupings.

sns.pairplot(): Plot pairwise relationships in a dataset.

sns.heatmap(): Plot rectangular data as a color-encoded matrix.

matplotlib.pyplot:
plt.figure(): Creates a new figure.

plt.subplot(): Adds a subplot to the current figure.

plt.plot(): Plots lines and/or markers to the Axes.

plt.bar(): Makes a bar plot.

plt.xlabel() and plt.ylabel(): Sets the labels for the x and y axes.

These functions and methods are commonly used for loading data, exploring it, and visualizing it in various forms using pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.pyplot in Python data analysis projects.
